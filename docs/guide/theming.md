# Theming

oxide-code's TUI palette is fully user-configurable. Pick one of the bundled Catppuccin or Material palettes, point at a TOML file you wrote yourself, or patch individual color slots on top of any base. No recompile.

## Quick start

```toml
# ox.toml or ~/.config/ox/config.toml

# Built-in name (mocha, macchiato, frappe, latte, material) or filesystem path.
[tui.theme]
base = "latte"

# Patch individual slots on top of the base.
[tui.theme.overrides]
error = "#ff0000"
accent = { bold = false }
```

Both `[tui.theme]` keys are optional. Without them the default is `mocha` (Catppuccin Mocha) with no overrides.

## Built-in themes

| Name        | Family     | Variant                |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| `mocha`     | Catppuccin | Dark — neutral default |
| `macchiato` | Catppuccin | Medium-dark            |
| `frappe`    | Catppuccin | Medium                 |
| `latte`     | Catppuccin | Light                  |
| `material`  | Material   | Dark — M2 baseline     |

Each ships as a vendored TOML file [in the source tree][themes-src] and doubles as a copy-paste starting point for custom themes.

## Custom theme files

`base` accepts any filesystem path to a TOML body using the same shape as the vendored themes. A leading `~/` expands to `$HOME`; no other expansion happens — environment variables (`$HOME`, `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}`) and Windows-style references (`%USERPROFILE%`) are passed through literally and will fail to read. Relative paths are resolved against the process working directory, not the config file directory; prefer absolute or `~/`-anchored paths.

```toml
[tui.theme]
base = "~/.config/ox/themes/dark-extra.toml"
```

If the value isn't a built-in name AND can't be read as a file, oxide-code refuses to start with an actionable error message.

## Slot value formats

Every `fg` / `bg` value, and every bare-string slot, accepts:

| Form              | Example      | Maps to                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6-digit hex       | `"#cdd6f4"`  | 24-bit RGB                                                            |
| ANSI 16 named     | `"red"`      | terminal palette color (see list)                                     |
| Indexed 256-color | `"ansi:174"` | 256-color palette index                                               |
| Terminal default  | `"reset"`    | the terminal default for whichever channel (`fg` or `bg`) it's set to |

ANSI 16-color names accepted (case-insensitive):

- **Standard** — `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `gray` (alias `grey`).
- **Bright** — `dark_gray` (alias `dark_grey`), `bright_red` (alias `light_red`), `bright_green` (alias `light_green`), `bright_yellow` (alias `light_yellow`), `bright_blue` (alias `light_blue`), `bright_magenta` (alias `light_magenta`), `bright_cyan` (alias `light_cyan`), `white` (alias `bright_white` / `light_white`).

See the [ANSI escape code reference][ansi] for what each name maps to in your terminal's palette. Three-digit hex shorthand (`#fff`) is intentionally rejected — always use the full six digits.

## Slot definitions

A custom theme file must define **every slot** — a missing slot is a parse error so typos surface immediately. For partial customization on top of a base, use `[tui.theme.overrides]` instead (see [Overrides](#overrides) below).

> **Note:** the same `slot = "#hex"` line means different things in a theme file vs an override. Inside a theme file body, it's a bare-color slot definition with `fg` set and `bg` / modifiers cleared. Inside `[tui.theme.overrides]`, it's a _patch_ that updates only `fg` and preserves the base slot's `bg` and modifiers. The override semantics are detailed in [Overrides](#overrides).

A theme TOML is a flat document with one entry per slot. Two shapes:

- **Bare color string** — `fg`-only, no modifiers:

  ```toml
  user = "#fab387"
  blockquote = "#a6e3a1"
  ```

- **Inline table** — explicit `fg` / `bg` and any modifier flags:

  ```toml
  accent = { fg = "#89b4fa", bold = true }
  link = { fg = "#89b4fa", underlined = true }
  diff_add = { bg = "#2a3a37" }
  ```

Recognized modifier keys: `bold`, `italic`, `underlined`, `dim`, `reversed`. Unknown keys fail the parse. In a theme file, modifier keys are plain booleans defaulting to `false`.

## Slots

Each slot maps to one role in the TUI. Override a slot by name to restyle that role.

### Text hierarchy

| Slot    | Role                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `text`  | Primary text                         |
| `muted` | Secondary text, labels, soft borders |
| `dim`   | Dimmed metadata, timestamps          |

### Surfaces

| Slot      | Role                                                  |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `surface` | Chat / input / status panel background fill (bg-only) |

> **Always declare `surface` as an inline table with `bg`** — e.g. `surface = { bg = "#1e1e2e" }` or `surface = { bg = "reset" }`. A bare-string `surface = "#1e1e2e"` would route to `fg` (per the slot-definition rules above) and silently repaint every panel's text in the surface color.

### Semantic accents

| Slot        | Role                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `accent`    | Highlights, active borders (bold) |
| `user`      | User message bar / icon           |
| `assistant` | Assistant message bar / icon      |

### Status indicators

| Slot      | Role                                               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `info`    | In-progress / neutral signals (e.g., streaming)    |
| `success` | Successful tool results, ready status              |
| `warning` | Warnings, caution status (reserved for future use) |
| `error`   | Errors, failed tools, critical status              |

### Code

| Slot          | Role                                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `code`        | Fenced code blocks with no recognized language |
| `inline_code` | Inline `code` spans (between backticks)        |

### Diff backgrounds (bg-only)

| Slot       | Role                                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `diff_add` | Background fill for added rows in Edit diffs |
| `diff_del` | Background fill for deleted rows             |

### Markdown headings

| Slot            | Role                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `heading_h1`    | H1 — most prominent (bold + underlined) |
| `heading_h2`    | H2 — bold section header                |
| `heading_h3`    | H3 — bold italic                        |
| `heading_minor` | H4–H6 — italic                          |

### Markdown body

| Slot          | Role                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `thinking`    | Dimmed thinking text (italic)        |
| `link`        | Markdown links (underlined)          |
| `blockquote`  | Blockquote prefix marker             |
| `list_marker` | Bullet / number marker on list items |

### Markdown chrome

| Slot              | Role                |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `horizontal_rule` | `---` rule          |
| `table_header`    | Table header cell   |
| `table_border`    | Table border glyphs |

### UI chrome

| Slot               | Role                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `tool_border`      | Left border for tool call blocks       |
| `tool_icon`        | Per-tool icon                          |
| `border_focused`   | Focused component border (e.g., input) |
| `border_unfocused` | Unfocused component border             |
| `separator`        | Status bar separator (dimmed pipe)     |

## Overrides

`[tui.theme.overrides]` is a table of `slot_name = patch` pairs. A patch is _additive_ — only the fields it lists are applied to the base slot.

```toml
[tui.theme.overrides]
# Bare-string form — patches fg only; bg and modifiers come from the base.
error = "#ff0000"
# Inline form — patches just modifiers; fg / bg come from the base.
accent = { bold = false }
# Inline form — patches fg AND adds bold.
link = { fg = "#ff79c6", bold = true }
```

Modifier flags use **three-state semantics**:

| Flag value | Effect on the base modifier         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| omitted    | no change — base value is preserved |
| `true`     | sets the bit                        |
| `false`    | clears the bit                      |

So `accent = { bold = false }` removes bold from the base accent without disturbing its color. `accent = { italic = true }` adds italic without removing the base bold. An entirely empty patch (`accent = {}`) warns and falls back to the base — it would otherwise silently re-write the base with itself, almost certainly a config bug.

## Errors

Bisected severity:

- **Theme selection errors** are fatal. An unknown built-in name with no matching file path, a file that can't be read, a file with a parse error in the base body — any of these stop oxide-code at startup with a message identifying what went wrong.
- **Per-slot value errors** warn and fall back. If an override's color string can't be parsed, its slot name isn't recognized, or an inline patch is empty, oxide-code logs a warning to stderr and uses the base slot's value for that role. The TUI still launches.

The default tracing level is `warn`, so per-slot fallback messages surface without requiring `RUST_LOG`. Routing depends on mode:

- **TUI** — diagnostics go to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/ox/log/oxide-code.log` (default `~/.local/state/ox/log/oxide-code.log`). Routing to a file keeps `warn!` output off the alternate screen, where it would otherwise paint over the rendered frame.
- **Bare REPL / headless / `--list`** — diagnostics go to stderr, the natural CLI surface.

Set `RUST_LOG=info` (or `debug`) for more detail. The same routing applies in both modes.

## Examples

### Minimal — switch to Latte

```toml
[tui.theme]
base = "latte"
```

### Mocha base + a brighter error color

```toml
[tui.theme.overrides]
error = "#ff5555"
```

(`base` defaults to `mocha` when omitted.)

### Custom theme file with a few overrides on top

```toml
[tui.theme]
base = "~/.config/ox/themes/dracula.toml"

[tui.theme.overrides]
accent = { fg = "#bd93f9", bold = true }
link = { fg = "#8be9fd", underlined = true }
```

### Use the terminal's foreground for primary text

```toml
[tui.theme.overrides]
text = "reset"
```

Useful for transparent / non-truecolor terminals where forcing an RGB foreground fights the user's terminal scheme.

### Tint the chat panel background

```toml
[tui.theme.overrides]
surface = { bg = "#1e1e2e" }
```

Default `surface` is `Color::Reset` (terminal background). Set a `bg` to give the chat / input / status panels an opaque tint — useful on transparent terminals.
